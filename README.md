# CinemaWeb
Student project

The project aimed to develop a management and operation system for cinema halls, in which the administrator could control the schedule of screenings, add new movies, and view all users along with their tickets.
A database was used to store the data, and this information was displayed in a web application, allowing users to reserve tickets and administrators to monitor the status of the halls.
To track environmental parameters in the projection rooms, a sensor system was employed. It sent measurements to the database via an ESP32 microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi communication.

Used technologies:
- ASP.NET,
- ASP.NET Core,
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- EF Core (Entity Framework Core)
- SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio)
